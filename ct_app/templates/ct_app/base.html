		Disclaimer: This website’s proprietor accepts no responsibility for any outcomes, good or bad, that may arise from employing the solutions set forth herein. His life experience is negligible. The most significant problem he has actually solved successfully was due nearly purely to chance: After an overnight stay at the Hilton in Durham, NC that also happened to be hosting a reunion of the actors that played Ewoks on the forest moon of Endor, he popped into the restaurant to grab a late brunch, and the panini digested quite quickly and left him wanting for rectal relief, so he slumped into the restroom, but was devastated to hear a trickle of pee followed by a forced sniffle emanating from one of the two stalls, indicating company, however his rumbling bowels left him no time to wait for privacy, so he crouched down to look for telltale dangling feet to discern which stall was occupied, but of course he could see no dangling feet because neither Ewoks nor their portrayers have such slack in their limbs, but he had to go really badly and couldn’t knock because that’s rude so he guessed that the stall closest to the door wouldn’t be occupied by a little guy. He was right; it was vacant.
