This is a middling website that I made for myself.

Dependencies:  
-Django 1.7.x  
-The appropriate bindings for whichever SQL DB you elect  
-Pillow  
-django-ratelimit 0.5  
-A computer (plugged in)  

The output of this project may be viewed at http://christiantreubig.com/.

With any luck, the Syrian Electronic Army or ISIS will uncover countless exploits in the source code and hack my site into oblivion, thereby generating some sympathetic patriotic publicity for me.
